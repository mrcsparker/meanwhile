version 0.3.0 (2004-06-28)
		
	2004-06-27: Fixed bug #980572. Thanks a lot to Joe Marcus Clarke
	for all the debugging help!

	* common.c: privacy list has a name in it, who knew?

	* st_list.c: revamped the parsing and generation of sametime's
	buddy list format. Seems to be working alright, but there can be
	some serious ugliness with commas in user ids and in aliases.
	
	2004-06-23: Sametime blist format parser/generator seems to be
	working.

	* common.c: fixed a nasty crash/bug discovered by nosnilmot. Base
	type serialization wasn't correctly checking available buffer
	lengths, leading to unhealthy overruns. Won't happen anymore.
	
	* srvc_aware.c: fixed nasty bug in removing entries from a list
	which made the whole service unstable.

	* st_list.c, st_list.h: added to CVS. Simple API for loading and
	storing a heirarchy of group/users into a sametime format list.
	
	2004-06-21: Bug fix and API cleanup.

	* service.c, service.h: refinements to service start/stop and
	state checking
	
	* srvc_im.c: fixed a reported bug where messages were not being
	rejected even when the user was in mwStatus_BUSY. Thanks jdob!
	
	2004-06-18: Hopefully fixed bug #968973, requires testing by
	someone normally afflicted

	* channel.c, channel.h: added mwChannel_markActive
	
	* service.c, service.h: added start/stop, as well as related state
	tracking calls and utility functions
	
	* session.c: effectively rewrote mwSession_recv
	
	* srvc_store.c, srvc_store.h: added to CVS
	
	2004-06-15: Reworking services to follow a start/stop system.
	Moving service structures into a non-visible space.  Added support
	for the storage service.  Meanwhile now has its own client type
	identifier, 0x1700, and defaults to using that rather than the
	Java App identifier of 0x1003
	
version 0.2  Chris O'Brien  <siege@preoccupied.net>

	2004-05-17: Refactoring service and channel related code out of
	session.[ch], started using g_return_* functions.  Moved
	meanwhile-gaim plugin into its own module, for my own sanity.

version 0.1  Chris O'Brien  <siege@preoccupied.net>
	
	2004-04-23: Release against Gaim 0.77, tagged v0_77

	2004-04-20: Changed buddy list status text to be their message
	rather than the name of their state.  If there's no status
	message, it still falls back to the state name.  Updates to match
	Gaim 0.77cvs.  Chat rejection should be working now; Admin
	messages might work.  Difficult to test as only admins can send
	those messages.

	2004-04-14: Added meanwhile-gaim.spec, tagged it into v0_76.
	First rpm released
	
	2004-04-05: Release against Gaim 0.76, tagged v0_76

	2004-02-25: Added Features: create a conference with another user.
	This seems to work with pretty much any client on the receiving
	end; accept a conference from another user.  This seems to work
	with only some clients. eg: Sanity works, ICT doesn't.
	
	2004-02-23: First import to IIOSB CVS

	Features: working buddy list; status and away messages; idle
	timer; send/receive im; encryption support; lovable icon
